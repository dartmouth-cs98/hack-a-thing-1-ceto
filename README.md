#### Short Description of What Was Built
- A small iOS app capable of playing a game of war
-  Cards are randomly generated whenever the deal button is pressed and the winner (if not a tie) gains a point
- While obviously this was a very basic app, I think being able to better understand app design/creation for iOS and the Swift language could be very helpful for what I want to do in my final project
---
#### What Description of What Was Learned
- This was my first time dealing with the storyboard for XCode as well as general iOS development
- Using a graphical interface builder is interesting and very helpful, I appreciated being able to layout the setup of the app before having to connect the pieces
- This borught back the Model-View-Controller concepts that I learned during CS65 a little while ago

#### What Didn't Work
- This particular portion of the tutorial didn't seem to be too difficult or time consuming (other than getting XCode set up properly), so I'm hoping to dive a bit deeper and add some additional features
